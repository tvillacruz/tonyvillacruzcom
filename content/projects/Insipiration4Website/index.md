# Background

I was inspired to create this website in order to take my first step towards becoming a full stack problem solver. 

Before I proceed to discussing my journey of building my website, I want to discuss what it means to be a full stack problem solver. My business partner Pete Dunham and I decided to start a concept that we call  **Full Stack Problem Solving**. Full stack problem solving requires doing 3 basic actions: _Learn_, _Apply_, _Teach_.

* **LEARN** - Learning is the first step in the process and can often be the most intimidating. But the key is just be willing to take the first step!

* **APPLY** - Knowledge is great, but only if you can use it. It is important to apply what you know, because in doing so you will unlock the ability to truly master something.

* **TEACH** - This might be the most overlooked part of problem solving. Being able to learn and apply what you know is important, but if the only person who benefits from that knowledge is you, then can you really say it makes a difference? It is this ability to take what you know and teach it to others, that can set you apart from the rest.

Now what does that have to do with me building this website? Well in order to apply these actions, I decided to start by learning how to create a website. My hope is that I can use this as a platform to showcase what I learn and to do it in a way that others can hopefully use to grow themselves!

# Learning How to Build a Website

I had to first begin my journey by taking the time to research what all goes into a website, research how I can learn to do it myself, and find the best platform to apply this new found knowledge. 

I decided to start by talking to my mentor Pete Dunham, who told me that creating a personal website can not only help advance my web developing skills but also be a great place to share experiences, thoughts, and ideas with others. He said the place to start would be to first learn about the idea of "_Open Source_".

Open Source is a term that refers to source code that is released in such a manner that the copyright holder grants users the rights to use, study, change, and distribute the code to anyone and for any purpose. Put another way, open source coding is the concept of building code in a such a way that it is free and available for others to use in order to help them grow themselves as well. It is a concept that allows people to learn from one another by sharing their ideas and discoveries.

A great open source platform for website building is known as Hugo. Hugo is one of the most popular open-source static site generators. They believe that with its amazing speed and flexibility, they can make building websites fun again. _Link to Hugo: https://gohugo.io/_. Hugo allows web developers to create and upload website templates or "themes" that they have built. These themes can then be downloaded and altered by users to use for their own purposes.

 I decided to use Pete's modified version of the [Hugo Refresh](https://themes.gohugo.io/hugo-refresh/) theme to begin my reseach. By being able to download Pete's code I was able to see all of the components that go into making these websits, and use that to learn all of the parts and pieces that go on behind the scenes in order to make a website. Plus, the majority of the themes that are posted in Hugo come with a set of instructions for how to get started and how to start making this template your own. This allowed me to move on to my next step in my fsps journey, Applying this knowledge by building my own website.
