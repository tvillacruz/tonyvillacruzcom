From time to time I get asked about what resources I can recommend to someone looking to expand their “Full Stack” skill set.  I’ll continue to grow the list below but below are resources I highly recommend.

# 1. “What is Code?” By Paul Ford

This article explains everything on the software spectrum from burning barrels full of cash to what it takes a computer to print an “A” on the screen.  The first time I read this.. my mind was blown. The full article is available online for free here.  Because of some visual animations I find the online version somewhat difficult to consume. I recommend googling for the PDF and reading that (also free).   I treasure my soft copy but they seem to be difficult to come by.

# 2. Steve Yegge’s Google+/AWS Rant

The rant is available here and is a great retrospective on the rise of platform as a service.

Buried in this angry rant are some nuggets on Amazon’s transition to AWS and platform approach. The rant is from 2011 but has history back to mid-2000s.

The summary below is  taken from this wikipedia article: 

Accidental posting: Yegge accidentally made an internal Google memo public on Google+ in October 2011. His 3,700-word comment garnered major media and blogger attention for Yegge's pointed commentary criticizing the leanings of the company's technological culture (such as labeling Google+'s minimalist and, in his view, lackluster public platform "a pathetic afterthought") as well as for his comments about his former employer, Amazon (such as calling Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos "Dread Pirate Bezos"). Google co-founder Sergey Brin stated that he would still have his job.[24] Washington Post reporter Melissa Bell stated that Yegge's public rant was a Jerry Maguire moment.

# 2. The Unix Shell (terminal, command line) 

https://swcarpentry.github.io/shell-novice/

Using a computer terminal, shell, command line is a requirement for doing full stack development.  I found this free course, The Unix Shell, by SW Carpentry to be an amazingly comprehensive crash course on using the Unix Shell.   

Here is the introduction taken directly from the site: “The Unix shell has been around longer than most of its users have been alive. It has survived so long because it’s a power tool that allows people to do complex things with just a few keystrokes”

 Note: This carries over to the terminal in Mac and command line programs in Windows, as well.

# 6. Data Manipulation at Scale: Systems and Algorithms (Course on Coursera Platform)

This was an amazing course to complete start to finish. Described as 21 hour effort,  I think it took me somewhat longer to complete which included 3 graded assignments. The course instructor Dr. Bob Howe has an amazing way of describing the era of big data and it’s impact to systems thinking  I’d recommend starting and finishing the complete course, but if nothing else watch the lectures.
