In Atlassian Cloud Jira an issue collector allows public submission of issues into a specific project within your Cloud Jira Instance. This can be useful for soliciting feedback, support issue logging by your customers, and managing surveys. 

### PROS:
  - Public submission (no need to add users for them to _submit_ to Jira)
  - Can embed in a webpage or Confluence page
  
### CONS
  - Need a webserver to server up the small html, javascript snippet
  - It's tempting (and probably futile) to expand a bunch of custom fields to make a form instance (Jira Service Desk a   separate product helps solve this problem)
