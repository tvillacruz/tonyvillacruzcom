From time to time I get asked about what resources I can recommend to someone looking to begin their fullstack journey. Here is my on-going attempt to assemble a full stack canon:
 
{{< book title="What is Code?" authors="Paul Ford" image="images/What_is_Code.jpg" size="x600">}} This article explains everything on the software spectrum from burning barrels full of cash to what it takes a computer to print an “A” on the screen. 

 The first time I read this.. my mind was blown.

  The full article is available online for free [here](https://www.bloomberg.com/graphics/2015-paul-ford-what-is-code/).  

Because of some visual animations I find the online version somewhat difficult to consume. I recommend googling for the PDF and reading that (also free).{{</book>}}

His 3,700-word comment garnered major media and blogger attention for Yegge's pointed commentary criticizing the leanings of the company's technological culture (such as labeling Google+'s minimalist and, in his view, lackluster public platform &quot;a pathetic afterthought&quot;) as well as for his comments about his former employer, Amazon (such as calling Amazon CEO <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeff_Bezos">Jeff Bezos</a> &quot;Dread Pirate Bezos&quot;).

{{< book title="The Joel Test: 12 Steps to Better Code" authors="Joel Spolsky" image="images/JoelTest.png" size="x600">}} 

 Read [The Joel Test](https://www.joelonsoftware.com/2000/08/09/the-joel-test-12-steps-to-better-code/)

Joel cofounded StackOverflow. But before that, he wrote 12 Steps to Better Code which was the precusor to the cultural shift to Agile and DevOps. The 12 steps seem like no-brainers now but that's because Joel articulated them in this post and then this post made its rounds.

{{< book title="The Unix Shell" authors="Software Carpentry Foundation" image="images/terminal_icon.png" size="x600">}} 

Course, Walk-Thru Here:[The Unix Shell](https://swcarpentry.github.io/shell-novice/)

Using a computer terminal, shell, command line is a requirement for doing full stack development.  I found this free course, The Unix Shell, by SW Carpentry to be an amazingly comprehensive crash course on using the Unix Shell.

Here is the introduction taken directly from the site:

{{< exercise >}}
The Unix shell has been around longer than most of its users have been alive. It has survived so long because it’s a power tool that allows people to do complex things with just a few keystrokes. More importantly, it helps them combine existing programs in new ways and automate repetitive tasks so they aren’t typing the same things over and over again. Use of the shell is fundamental to using a wide range of other powerful tools and computing resources (including “high-performance computing” supercomputers). These lessons will start you on a path towards using these resources effectively.
