I was contemplating (procrastinating) this website for sometime but I was finally pushed over the edge by:

- Watching [this excellent talk](#Talk)
- Reading [this book](#Book)
- Referencing others' [personal sites](#Sites)



<a id="Talk"></a>

<div class="box">

        <p class="title is-3">The Unreasonable Effectiveness of Public Work</p>
        <p class="subtitle is-5">David Robinson</p>
      </div>
{{</ rawhtml >}}

Prior to finding this talk, I had randomly relied on several of David's (the presenter) open source contributions:

*	To understand something [The Beta Distribution](http://varianceexplained.org/statistics/beta_distribution_and_baseball/)
*	To do something [Natural Language Processing](https://www.tidytextmining.com/)
*	And to get better [Tidy Thinking](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sD993H5FBIY)

This made his talk even more powerful and personal for me since I have directly benefited by some of his stated examples!

<a id="Book"></a>
{{< book title="Get a Job, Build a Real Career and Defy a Bewildering Economy" authors="Charles Hugh Smith" image="images/CHSmith.jpg" size="x600">}} 
[This book](https://www.amazon.com/Build-Real-Career-Bewildering-Economy/dp/1497533406) is an interesting read. Hughes forecasts industries that are ripe for disruption and provides commentary on structural suboptimization in some education and employment practices. The key takeaway that was motivating was Hughes' emphasis on the necessity for "self-accrediation". Here is a quick quote:
